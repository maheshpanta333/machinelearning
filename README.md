# 🚀 Machine Learning & Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my repository where I track my progress in Machine Learning! This repo contains a collection of notebooks and models I've built while learning and working on real-world projects.

## 🛠 Projects & Models

| Project Name | Model Type | Description | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Road Issue Classifier** | CNN / Keras | Classifies civic issues from outdoor images (Potholes, etc.) | [View Notebook](./road-issue-and-non-issue-classifier.ipynb) |
| **Decision Tree Basics** | Scikit-Learn | Using Decision Trees to understand classification logic. | [View Notebook](./titanic-survivability-predicting-model.ipynb) |

## 🏗️ Project Breakdown: Road Issue Classifier
This is an initial CNN model designed to help classify road infrastructure problems.

* **Core Goal:** To identify whether an image contains a road issue or is a clean outdoor shot.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, Pandas.
* **Key Metrics:** * Accuracy: ~92.5%
    * Precision: ~93.6%
    * Recall: ~96.4%

## ⚙️ How to Run
Most of these models were developed on **Kaggle**. To run them:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git`
2. Open the `.ipynb` files in Jupyter, VS Code, or Google Colab.
